# mighty

This is an exploration of various ways of representing frequent pattern analysis
in clojure. This is all experimental code so nothing here is really worth using
in production. Mainly it is just my attempt to learn *how* to do it before I
create something that is production worthy.

## Usage

Just type mighty and let it go! Actually bring up any of the files in Light Table
and execute.
